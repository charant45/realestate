## Setup and Installation
<pre>

2. Ensure you have PHP (7.4+) and MySQL installed on your system.
3. Set up a web server (e.g., Apache) to serve the PHP files.
4. Create a new MySQL database for the project (see [Database Configuration](#database-configuration)).
5. Update the database connection details in database.php.
6. Place the project files in your web server's document root or set up a virtual host.
</pre>  

## Database Configuration
<pre>
1. Create a new MySQL database named real_estate.
2. Import the following SQL schema to create the necessary tables:

CREATE TABLE listings (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    location VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    bedrooms INT NOT NULL,
    bathrooms INT NOT NULL,
    image_url VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Add more tables as needed (e.g., users, payments)

3.Update the database connection details in database.php:
$db_host = 'localhost';
$db_name = 'real_estate';
$db_user = 'your_username';
$db_pass = 'your_password';
